        <h1>Utkarsh</h1>
        <p class="tag"> Mechanical Engineer · CAD &amp; FEA Simulation</p>
        <p class="lead">My passion for CAD design began when I was an automotive engineer 
          working on Formula Student projects. It wasn't just about building vehicles that 
          ran — it was about creating designs that won on an international stage. Through 
          countless hours of modeling, refining, and troubleshooting, I realized that CAD 
          design is far more than drawing parts; it's about thinking holistically, from assembly 
          and cost efficiency to material selection, manufacturability, and how every component 
          interacts in the real world. Each design decision feels like solving a puzzle that 
          blends engineering precision with creativity. What excites me most is how CAD challenges 
          me to innovate, to turn ideas into something tangible, elegant, and functional. It allows me
          to work on something that not only works but makes sense in every dimension.</p>

        <h3>Project 1 — Formula Manipal (FSAE)</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
            Formula Manipal is Manipal University's official Formula Student Racing Team (FSAE). Members
            are students of Manipal Institute of Technology, who conceptualize, design, fabricate, 
            test, and race a single seater formula style car. I led the team as Technical Lead at 
            Formula Bharat competition, where we achieved 1st place in the Acceleration Event, 1st in Business
             Presentation, and an overall 3rd position among national teams. Below are a few samples of my work 
             during this project.

            on a test vehicle. A Jetson AGX Xavier processes sensor
            data in real time using ROS 2 middleware, enabling synchronized recording and timestamp alignment through GNSS-
            based time correction. Some of the main components of the system are shown below.

        <h3>Project 3 — Zero Emmision Ambulance</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
            The project focused on designing a zero-emission, double-crewed ambulance 
            for the UK National Health Service (NHS). Two innovative concepts were 
            developed to provide operational flexibility while ensuring lightweight 
            construction, extended range, passenger comfort, and a low-floor design. 
            The solution emphasized sustainability, cost efficiency, and practicality 
            for deployment in urban environments such as London. My contribution to the project
            involved the design and development of the suspension system. This optimized
            ride comfort, handling, and overall driving performance of the vehicle. A couple of 
            my work samples have been presented here.
